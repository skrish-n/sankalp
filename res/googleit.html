<h1><b><i><u>Sankalp Technical Flagship Event: GoogleIt!</u></b></i></h1>
</center>
<h3>Hey guys, So GoogleIt as the name suggests is all about google-ing. We google many things in our day to day life but has it ever occured to you how accurately you are using your search keyword? There are certain input methods proven to give a better result in a Search Engine and learning them would save you time.</h3>
<br />
<br />

<ul>
<li><h4>GoogleIt is a team event where each team should consist of <b>2 Members</b></h4></li>
<li><h4>You will be given a set of images and clues of websites and the goal is to find <b>URL of the website</b>(the url need not be the exact page of the image, the main website URL will do :) )</h4></li>
<li><h4> So, it all comes down to how well you know popular websites and how well you use a search engine.</h4></li>
</ul>
<br/ 
<br/>
<h2>There will be 2 rounds</h2>
<ul>
<li><h4>The first round will have 15 questions each of 1 mark</h4></li>
<li><h4>Top 7 teams qualify for the finals, which will have 10 questions of increased difficulty</h4></li>

<h4><a href="home.html">Just to make youself familiar with the event, check out a sample from last year's contest</a></h4>

<h1><b><u>Sankalp Field Event: TUG OF WAR</u></b></h1>
</center>
<br />
<br />
<h3>The game involves usage of single equipment i.e. a rope. <br />There is a red mark made in the 
middle of the rope. <br/>This red mark on the rope needs to be at a perpendicular angle to the exact 
center point on the ground, before the commencement of the game. <br/>The game is won when either side 
with this white mark crosses the center point

</h3>
<h3>According to the rules of tug of war, each team can accommodate a maximum of 10 members. 
However the combined weight of these members should not exceed the weight determined for 
the particular category. <br/>
One team from each year from each branch<br/>
As mentioned earlier, the center of the rope should align with the center marked on the 
ground. As soon as the referee blows the whistle, each team can start pulling the rope into their 
territory. <br/>The objective of the game is for each team to pull the rope along with the members of 
opposition team to their side. <br/>As soon as the second mark on the rope from the center red 
mark crosses over to center line, the team to pull the rope to their area wins the game. 
Competition <br/>
The tug of war competition requires a judge. There are 3 different commands that the judge 
gives to the players. <br/>The judges first announces “Pick up the rope”, he then says “Take the 
string”, and finally he tells the players to “Pull”. <br/>Once the pull command is said out the teams 
start pulling the rope. <br/>If a member of the team falls down that member is given a caution. Each 
team is allowed two cautions before getting disqualified. 
<b><u>Fouls</b></u> 
There is a particular technique that needs to be applied while playing this game, if not then 
there will be a foul which can call in for disqualifications. For e.g. lowering your elbow below 
the knee level while pulling the rope is considered to be a foul and is called ‘locking’. Touching 
the ground for a longer period of time is also considered as a foul
